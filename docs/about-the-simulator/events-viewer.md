# Observability of each backtest action - Events viewer

The **Events Tab** was explicitly designed to provide in-depth **observability** for each trade.

:::info

We wanted to deviate from the black box approach used by some of the available backtesting applications and **display all actions executed during the backtesting run**.

:::

import Events1 from '/img/about-the-simulator/eventstab1.png';

<center>
    <img src={Events1} alt="Events1" style={{width: 700, boxShadow: '0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)'}} />
</center>

If you click into the table, the **keyboard navigation** becomes active, allowing you to use the ← and → keys to scroll through the pages.

Additionally, you can **access the values of each of the variables** at the given point in time by clicking the triangle in the leftmost column of the table.

import Events2 from '/img/about-the-simulator/eventstab2.png';

<center>
    <img src={Events2} alt="Events2" style={{width: 700, boxShadow: '0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)'}} />
</center>
