# Sharing of Results

Your backtest results are visible only to you by default. If you wish to share a particular run with someone, click on the Share radio button to enable sharing:

import Share1 from '/img/about-the-simulator/share1.png';

<center>
    <img src={Share1} alt="Share enabled" style={{width: 300}} />
</center>

When sharing is enabled, others who have the URL of your backtest will be able to see all the run details: PnL graph, Events, and Job Definition, and can clone from your backtest.  
Please note that **we require all users to be authenticated; therefore**, if you share the link with someone, they must register at the site first.

If you wish to **disable sharing,** click on the sharing radio button so that it becomes deactivated. When you disable sharing, your run will not be visible to others, even if they have the URL:

import Share2 from '/img/about-the-simulator/share2.png';

<center>
    <img src={Share2} alt="Share disabled" style={{width: 300}} />
</center>

To illustrate sharing, we provide the ‘best’ [benchmark run](https://portal.deltaray.io/backtests/d93ec692-b017-45d5-a7a9-845e9716a679) in this tutorial.
